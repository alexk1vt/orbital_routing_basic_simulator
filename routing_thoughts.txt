description of spherical geometry:

distance between two points on spherical plane:
https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/crow-flies-spherical-planet#:~:text=The%20shortest%20distance%20between%20any,the%20center%20of%20the%20sphere.

direction of one point to another:
- I think I already have this solved under the 'bearing' functions

so I want to minimize the distance from current location to destination
- two directions will minimize, two will not

what does DiScoRoute do?
